This plugin is a direct port from the Ant and Maven equivalents found at the [dbdeploy website](https://code.google.com/p/dbdeploy/wiki/GettingStarted)

dbdeploy is a Database Change Management tool. Itâ€™s for developers or DBAs who want to evolve their database design - or refactor their database -
in a simple, controlled, flexible and frequent manner.

## Usage

To use the plugin's functionality, you will need to add the binary artifact to your build script's classpath and apply the plugin.
